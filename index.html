      </div>
      <div class = "bio-text">
          Currently I am a 3rd year Physics Student at Imperial College London.  I am aspiring to work in something space-related.
          I was born in Belgium in the flemish region, but am lucky enough to have lived in London (UK), Houston (Texas) and Brisbane (Australia).
          My hobbies include cricket, american football (NFL), bouldering, hiking, rocketry and Space!
          Favourite place in the world? Australia, with New Zealand (*insert shocked pikachu meme*) a close second.
